        Hello my name is Dyllan Pham-Ada. I've recently started to learn how to
        create and code websites. I use to work in the Water Distribution
        Department, but it wasn't something that I wanted to do my whole life. I
        was always interested in computer and understanding how things worked. I
        learned about bootcamps for coding from my cousin and I decided to jump
        right in and try to change my life for the better. My contact info is
        down at the bottom and I hope to hear back from you soon. I'm really
        excited for you to check out my projects, I hope you enjoy.
      </p>
